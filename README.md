#The Artist Organizer
Build an artist organizer system. This system is a tool that any artist might use. It lets you keep track different events, application due dates and travel arrangements. It organizes the events by the application due date and by the event date itself. 

For example: I have a trade show event in Chicago that I am interested in showing at. I can store the basic event information such as date, time, location along with booth size, if the event is indoor or outdoor, and if different ammenities are included such as, tents, internet, tables, etc. Along with the event I can add the application information: due date, application requirements, application cost and cost of booth if accepted. When I send in my applicaton I can then check my applicatication as submited. If my applicaton is accepted I can then mark it as accepted and then add in travel arrangements. Travel arrangements allow for all the neccessary information with my transportation and hotel such as: departure date, time, location; approximate arrival; hotel location and check in; etc. 

##Description
Here are the different things that we have:

Some number of events (runway shows, trade shows, art gallery exhibits, etc.)
Some number of application information (due dates, submission information, application fee, etc.)
Some number of travel plans (transportation, hotel, etc.)
Some number of locations (Cities, buildings, etc.)

Each event has an application due date, some location and possible travel plans. Many events can be in the same location. Many locations can have the same event (ex. Renegade Craft Fair is one event that happens across the country). Travel and applicaton due date is specifc to individual events. 

The task is to build a database-driven web application to help manage this artist organizer. 

### "Should" cases
Should be able to do:

-Create, read, update and delete event records

-Create, update, delete locations

-Assign events to a location (a given location should be able to hold multiple events)

-Create, read, update and delete application information

-Assign application information to an event

-Create, read, update and delete travel plans

-Assign travel plans to an event

-Fetch all events in a given location

-Fetch all events in a given time frame (ex. user specifies the month they would like to see the events for)

-List all the application information according to due date

-List all the events according to due date

### "Should not" cases
What we should not be able to do:

-Be able to create an event without application information

-Be able to create application information without an event

-Delete a location without first checking that there are no events assigned to it
